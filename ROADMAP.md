# Roadmap – Sharpishly Research & Development

This is a rough, evolving roadmap. Priorities may change based on user feedback and actual needs.

## Near-term (next 1–3 months)

- Add proper LICENSE file (MIT recommended)
- Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, focus management)
- Add favicon + basic meta tags (description, theme-color, etc.)
- Create dark mode toggle / auto-detection
- Add smooth scroll behavior for in-page anchors
- Extract CSS variables to separate theme file(s)

## Medium-term (3–9 months)

- Add simple hero section component with background image option
- Create "Features" section layout (cards/grid)
- Add basic contact form (HTML + minimal JS validation)
- Implement scroll-to-top button
- Add basic page templates (pricing, about, contact)

## Longer-term / nice-to-have

- Full multi-page static site structure
- Add simple blog/news listing
- Customer portal login mockup / style guide
- Performance optimizations (lazy loading, font loading strategy)
- Add basic automated tests (e.g. Playwright smoke tests)
- Consider migrating to a lightweight static site generator (optional)

## Not planned (at this time)

- Using any frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte…)
- Backend integration
- Complex animations / heavy JavaScript

Feedback and pull requests welcome — especially for accessibility, mobile UX, and design improvements!
